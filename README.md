# JustInLetters
Twitch Chat based on the principles of Bionic Reading, a company founded in Switzerland. 

A great quote from their official [website](https://bionic-reading.com):
> Bionic ReadingÂ® revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly.

This is what it looks like :)
